         <h3 class="welcome h3">I am Ashwini Rathod, and in this page you can have a look at three different projects that I completed using HTML and CSS. All these projects made use of various CSS properties. CSS provides a wide range of styling options by using which we can design almost anything and everything. All the three projects below are quite different from one another and hence you will find a wide use of CSS properties that literally helps the page to come to life. So if this interests you and you also want to try creating your own web pages, then this page has all you will need. To know more about me or contact me, you can refer the top-right corner of the page.</h3>
